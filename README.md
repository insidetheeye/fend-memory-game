# Memory Game Project

Memory game is an interactive card game where a user turns over a card and attempts to find it's match in the deck. If the card is matched, it will stay flipped over. Otherwise, the cards will flip over. The goal is to memorize where certain cards sit in the deck and match each pair until all cards in the deck have been matched.

The deck is randomly shuffled at game play and reshuffles if the user resets the game. If the user wins and chooses to play again, the cards are reshuffled as well.

# Process

I wrote the functionality for this card game using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Process is as follows:

- write logic which generates the HTML for each card used in the game and add them to the game board
- compose the game time logic which evaluates if cards match, do not match, and define the game winning condition
- compose a variety of helper functions which support all aspects of game play (showing cards, matching cards, setting game timer, resetting game, producing modals before, during, and following a win)
- adding CSS animations to produce a more lively user experience
